data_generator.py

This script queries the Prometheus server which hosts all the relevant data regarding desktop 'up'
status as well as logged in users.
It produces a JSON file containing the mentioned information so that it can be queried by the frontend
and processed into a visual form for display

logged_in_users.sh
This shell script sits on every system so that the list of logged in users can be grabbed and then
packaged with the rest of the device's metrics when queried by Prometheus.
To keep this information up to date, the script is ran periodically by a cronjob (debian) or by a 
systemd timer (NixOS).
The output is a '.prom' file which is information specially formatted for PromQL queries. It is placed
in a /textfile-collector folder which is checked everytime node exporter refreshes with new information.
